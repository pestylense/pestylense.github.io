So I guess this is where I tell a story huh?

Joining [Poniverse](http://poniverse.net/) was not a direct thing even in the slightest. Even at this time I'm not an official member of it because I'm still only [Canterlot Avenue](http://canterlotavenue.com) staff. But here is my depiction of how this madness started.

For the longest time I was a member of this website called [PonySquare](http://pony.squares.im) (which may already be offline when you read this) and I was browsing around for where my next grand adventure would take me when some user on the website named "Dusk Shine" send me a random Discord Server invite. Out of all curiosity I just said "screw it take me in".

On this server I met "Spark" and "Heart Container" who I have had the pleasure of working with before so I immediately knew this project was legitimate and wanted to lend a hand to help this succeed. I ended up talking to Spark and I can't even remember what started it but I mentioned I would offer to help out. I decided I should prove my skill and do what I always do. Poke where I shouldnt but do anyway. This led to me meeting a few people like "Mercury" and "Feld0" after Heart and I had a long conversation.

After making the best chance to prove I had some fucking idea of what I was doing I was thrown in.

Do I regret it? Not at all.
Do I hate what I do? Sometimes

But in the end I'm happy to be a part of a team like this.
